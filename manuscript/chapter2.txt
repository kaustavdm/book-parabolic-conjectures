# Eastland ahoy!

It was almost dark. Mantri was lighting up the evening lamps when a hovermobile entered the lane. It scooted up his front porch and stopped outside the gate. The intercom crackled.

*"Ubu Ho of Special Corps reporting in, sir! I have got hostage Roth Beduin ready for transfer. Requesting authorization to enter premises to complete the task."*

*"It's okay, Ubu. Spare me the formalities. Just bring her in. Oh, and, leave your vehicle outside, and avoid tramping on my newly planted Petunias."*

*"Affirmative, sir! Ermm.. Okay."*

He gunned down the engine, got out of the vehicle and scanned his ID card at the security scanner on the door. The door slowly swung open inwards. In Eastland, it was considered discourtesy to open your doors outwards. That way, no one was ever confused about whether to push or pull the door. You push the door while coming in and pull the door while going out. Children in Eastland were taught that in their social sciences. It was simple and straightforward, like almost everything else in Eastland. But Roth did not grow up there. She pulled at the door.

*"You need to push it."*

*"Oh."*

*"What did they teach you in school?"*

*"History, Geography, Physics, Maths, Astronomy. Not how to open a door. We learnt that through trial and error."*

*"How so unobvious!"*
